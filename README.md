# Sample Node Web Scraper

I worked through a [Tutorial](https://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#) 
that explains how to scrape [table data](http://www.showmeboone.com/sheriff/JailResidents/JailResidents.asp) 
into CSV using python. 

This uses javascript instead of python and exports to JSON. 

# To run
- `npm install` to install node modules
- `npm start` will start a port on localhost:8000 where you can see the compiled
json. It will also create output.json in the directory.
